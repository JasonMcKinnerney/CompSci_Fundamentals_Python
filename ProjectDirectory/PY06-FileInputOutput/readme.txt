This is a practice exercise for Chapter 6 (files) and 8 (strings). 
You are given an input file with data you must read in, process, and write out. 
The input file looks like this:

one,1
two,2
three,3
four,4
five,5

Do not alter the input file. 
Process the input file, and write out a file out.dat that looks like this:

1,one,1
2,two,3
3,three,6
4,four,10
5,five,15

The numbers at the end are the accumulation of all previous numbers.
DO NOT hardcode that, you must calculate the number on the fly. 
You are given the exact algorithm to do this in the practice.py file.
Just follow the algorithm and convert the comments to code. 
Notice the input file has an extra newline at the end, but the output file will not. 
This is on purpose. You always have to account for empty newlines at the end of files.
